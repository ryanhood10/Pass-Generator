# Pass-Generator

This is my password generator website. As a user, after you click "generate password" you are prompted to choose character length and a few other details on what you want your password to include. You are then displayed a randomized password sequence. It will not accept inputs that are not string numbers or integers. Also if you click cancel on all four prompts, it automatically makes you a passcode of all lowercase letters.
